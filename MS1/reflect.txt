I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

When I first opened the final project I was shocked at how much content there was. But after reading the content of the project I was no longer worried because it was essentially a combined version of everything we had learnt before.

But I did encounter some minor problems when doing milestone 1, such as some syntax issues, but after referencing back to the previous notes they were no longer a problem.

To be honest milestone 1 isn't that hard if you study hard in class, hopefully, the rest of the work won't be too hard either.
